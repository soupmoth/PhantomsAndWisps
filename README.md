# Phantoms and Wisps

This mod is an overhaul to the Phantoms and how they interact with the game, turning them into a useful but optional part of the game. In addition, this mod is intended to be a light extension to the game, themed around the Phantoms and their dream ghostly aquatic theming. It takes the definition of Vanilla+ very loosely, by adding new mobs, a new biome, many new blocks and items, a new mineral for upgrading Diamond armour. The intention is to develop an experience that could fit into the game very nicely.

# New Biome: The Astral River

Deep in the earth, meteorites shared by the moon dwell, harbouring quaint, alien life that gives a sense of relief in a typically dangerous expedition into the mines. Be careful however, as while most creatures in this starlit biome are harmless, there are still dangers to be found deep into the shimmering caves.

# New Mobs

Currently there are three new mobs in development, with a further 2 planned or in conceptualisation.
-Wisps; Jellyfish like travellers that carry the dreams of creatures. Approaching Wisps on the surface when exhausted leads to them getting angry at the tired player; where they summon their Phantom friends for a hunt.
-Angelfish; Ambient mob that spawns in the Astral River.
-Glowcow; A glowing cow, where its milk is enough to make you glow a bright hue! Spawns passively in the Astral River, and they like to eat some of the local vegetation.
